    <h3 style="color:green">The 19th amendment granted women the right to vote and was passed by congress in June 4, 1919 and was ratified on August 18, 1920. It allows all women that are american the right to vote, and this has been a great achievement for those women that fought all of their life for the right to vote and more. Another legal implication that was passed was in 1963 in which there was an act that was passed on June 10th called the Equal Pay Act which made it illegal for employers to pay a women less than a man for doing the same job. Also in 1973 there was a case taken to the Supreme Court that ruled unconstitutional a state law that banned all abortions except to save the life of the mother.</h3>
