            <h2 style="color:blue">Legal Implications</h2>
    <h3 style="color:green">Leagal Implications of the change (Laws, Supreme Court legislation)</h3>
    <h3 style="color:green">The 19th amendment granted women the right to vote and was passed by congress in June 4, 1919 and was ratified on August 18, 1920. It allows all women that are american the right to vote, and this has been a great achievement for those women that fought all of their life for the right to vote and more. Another legal implication that was passed was in 1963 in which there was an act that was passed on June 10th called the Equal Pay Act which made it illegal for employers to pay a women less than a man for doing the same job. Also in 1973 there was a case taken to the Supreme Court that ruled unconstitutional a state law that banned all abortions except to save the life of the mother.</h3>

        <h3 style="color:green">Impact on the nation during and after the movement</h3>
        <h3 style="color:green">How did this impact the economy, social norms, life following the change?</h3>
        <h3 style="color:green">Between 1880 and 1910 the amount of women who were employed in the US went up from 2.6 million to 7.8 million. Even though more women were being employed in places like business and industry, more better paying jobs still went to men. In areas of politics at the turn of the century, women were now able to control their earnings, own land and property, and take custody of children in cases of divorce. “The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed on February 18, 1890 to work for women's suffrage in the United States. It was created by the merger of two existing organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)” (Google).</h3>
       
            <h2 style="color:blue">Historical Context</h2>
        <h3 style="color:green">During WWII, the men were fighting for the U.S, which left the factories unmanned. To keep the steady stream of bullets coming out of the factories, women were hired to work in the factories (don't know if they were paid). After WWII was one, the men came back and started working again. The women were angry because after the men came back, they were thrown aside like trash, and put back in their homes. To prove that they could work like men, they started a campaign with this picture to prove that they were capable of working jobs that men had done for a long time.</h3>
