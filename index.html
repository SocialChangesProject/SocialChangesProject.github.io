            <h2 style="color:mediumturquoise">Background</h2>
    <h3 style="color:green">Woman got the right to vote in 1920 after years of fighting for it. This happened because of great leaders like Susan B Anthony who was possibly the most well known women's rights activist in history. Some would argue that the fight for women's rights started long before the Women's suffrage organizations were even formed in fact they say it began “On a summer day in 1848, more than 300 men and women crowded into a chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. According to the History Channel, this gathering marked the formal beginning of the women's voting rights movement, which culminated in 1919 with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution.”</h3>
    
            <h2 style="color:mediumturquoise">Legal Implications</h2>
    <h3 style="color:green">The 19th amendment granted women the right to vote and was passed by congress in June 4, 1919 and was ratified on August 18, 1920. It allows all women that are american the right to vote, and this has been a great achievement for those women that fought all of their life for the right to vote and more. Another legal implication that was passed was in 1963 in which there was an act that was passed on June 10th called the Equal Pay Act which made it illegal for employers to pay a women less than a man for doing the same job. Also in 1973 there was a case taken to the Supreme Court that ruled unconstitutional a state law that banned all abortions except to save the life of the mother.</h3>
    
            <h2 style="color:mediumturquoise">First Hand Account</h2>
    <h3 style="color:green">A first hand account from a diary states that she was arrested many times while she attempts to protest and get freedom"Disgusted with the verdict and realizing that for the first time Mullowney was showing wisdom—undoubtedly advised from higher up—we went back to Cameron House—conferred and entered upon a war of attrition deciding to go out again at once on the second picket. 11 dropped out. Their courage weakening—but 10 new ones came in—so at 4:30 again the line went out—but this time all together. Mrs. Brannow leading. Again the friendly crowds—cheering and applauding. A woman came to me and said, "How I admire your courage" Men said "Magnificent spunk," etc. Again we were arrested—went through the same proceeding—bail was put up and back to headquarters we went. When I came out of the Commissioner's office several officers were standing and one said 'Please ladies—don't do it again—we hate to arrest you.' As a matter of fact Sullivan said to me the first day 'Ah Madam—you don't know how I hate to do this.' Mrs. Ramsey, cousin of prosecuting attorney Hart, told me that he was nearly converted to our policy, and that the entire police force was really with us."This shows how this town agreed with her and hated arresting her.</h3>

             <h2 style="color:mediumturquoise">Impact on the Nation</h2>
        <h3 style="color:green">Impact on the nation during and after the movement</h3>
        <h3 style="color:green">How did this impact the economy, social norms, life following the change?</h3>
        <h3 style="color:green">Between 1880 and 1910 the amount of women who were employed in the US went up from 2.6 million to 7.8 million. Even though more women were being employed in places like business and industry, more better paying jobs still went to men. In areas of politics at the turn of the century, women were now able to control their earnings, own land and property, and take custody of children in cases of divorce. “The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed on February 18, 1890 to work for women's suffrage in the United States. It was created by the merger of two existing organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA)” (Google).</h3>
       
            <h2 style="color:mediumturquoise">Historical Context</h2>
        <h3 style="color:green">During WWII, the men were fighting for the U.S, which left the factories unmanned. To keep the steady stream of bullets coming out of the factories, women were hired to work in the factories. After WWII was won, the men came back and started working again. The women were angry because after the men came back, they were thrown aside like trash, and put back in their homes. To prove that they could work like men, they started a campaign with this picture to prove that they were capable of working jobs that men had done for a long time.</h3>
